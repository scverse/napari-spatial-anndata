# Limitations

Contributions are welcomed!

- On macOS, the maximum point size is constrained ([details in the Vispy issue tracker](https://github.com/vispy/vispy/issues/2078));
  it is important to keep this in mind when zooming in on points to [explore the points property on mouse hover](https://github.com/scverse/napari-spatialdata/issues/35#issuecomment-2383792431).
- 3D data representation is supported in `spatialdata`; 3D data visualization is supported in `napari`.
  Still, in `napari-spatialdata` we currently don't support 3D data visualization.
